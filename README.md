This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple app I created to allow my son to learn times tables and division facts. There is probably a lot
more that could be done to improve it, like tracking correct answers, but it was a quick way
for me to practice working with React.
